								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p ></p>After conducting all 3 of the personality test from the internet, This test shows that its quite accurate and also it tells us whats my personality strengths and weaknesses that I could work on. As stated in the personality test that I am a Mediator I am more of a introveted person focusing my attention to just a few people.This also contributes to one of the strengths as I can built trust more as I value them more. However, trusting people too much can also be one of te weaknesses.Furthermore, it aksi states that I am a person who focuses more on the future rather than current this can be an advantage as being a software engineer requires me to be creative and also innovate for the future.</p>
								<p> After doing the second test, it shows that Im much more of a Visual Learner this basically means I am a person who learns better throught seeing things.The test shows that I am more effective in learning when using grpahical to study. Information which is put into diagrams and graphs are more effective way to learn for me.</p>
								<p> After conducting the third test this test measures the 5 major dimension of personality: Conscientiousness, Opennes, Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Neurocticism. It is conlcuded that I am a person that is interested in new ideas and mmore of a listener that a person who talks. </p>
								<p>In the future when working with others, it is important to show them what my strengths are and also my weaknesses so that my team can understand what they can do in order to cover up on the weaknesses that I am currently having. </p>
