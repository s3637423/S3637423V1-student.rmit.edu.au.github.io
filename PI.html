								<h2>Developing a smart phone application</h2>
								<p> Holding multiple items can be a problem especially when it comes to losing it. Annually, 30% of Australians are said to lost their wallets and 20% are to lost their house keys personally me myself I had also recently lost my hpuse keys. The project that I came up with is to create a application on smartphones for customers to gain access to even after losing their necessities. This application should includes multiple functions such as turning on electrical appliances at home, and operating basic machines.
								<p> With the modern technology era technologies on smartphones had became demanded by almost every smartphones users .The app will allow us to on machines whithout even turning them on physically Furthermore, this app will help their users to guide them on how to use the app . This will definitely help those people in reducing the amount of stuff to be carried making people demanding for this app.</p>
								</p> Multiple skills are needed to be adopt by the developer in order to have a successful project. Analytical skills is important it is the ability to analyse users behavior on applications.The developer must also be creative bringing this application into their daily lives. Lastly problem solving is important skill to acquire as troubleshooting ussues such as on android or ios most common device for users. The developer needs to understand on the problem and to resolve them at a given time frame.
								
						  If this project succeeds it can reduce the amount of things to be carried and people wouldnt have to be affraid of what they cannot access without the app. Risk such as stolen smartphones and also possible hackers are not yet to be resolved therefore more updates will be issued. Whenever this project is approved people can reduce carrying important stuff.</p>
